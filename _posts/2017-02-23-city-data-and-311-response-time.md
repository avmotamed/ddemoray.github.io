This is my first official blog post! I've created this in order to highlight side projects.

In February I completed a full-time immersive Data Science program that focused on data analysis, machine learning and modeling in Python. The program's curriculum consisted of classification, regression, clustering, git, SQL, relational databases, critical thinking, visualization, presentation and reporting skills.

For my final project, I conducted an analysis of New York Cityâ€™s 311 Data (>8MM rows) to build a model that predicts the length of time it takes to resolve resident complaints. I hosted data in a SQL database, cleaned data using Python, created visualizations using Matplotlib and Tableau. Next, I modeled data using Random Forest Classification to accurately predict resolution time to be shared with residents and public policy influencers.
