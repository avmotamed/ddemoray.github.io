I'm passionate about technology and education. I spent a few years working for the non-profit ["Education for The Poor"](http://www.educationforthepoor.org)(EFTP) while completing my B.A. in Business Economics at the [University of California, Irvine](http://uci.edu/about/index.php). While volunteering for EFTP, I focused my energy on expanding EFTP's community of volunteers and spent my summers teaching English in Vietnam.

What started selfishly as a way to travel the world and photograph the beauty of the Vietnamese countryside transformed me. Not only was I making a direct impact on my student's future well being through education - I was also sharing my culture with them in a way that so many people around the world are not fortunate enough to have the luxury of experiencing. EFTP's students welcomed me as a foreigner with open arms and immersed me in their culture and widened my perspective in a way that was unexpected.  The ability to make a positive lasting impact in someone's life is more rewarding than any paycheck.  This is what motivates me, the ability to make a tangible different in someone's life - be it through working on a collaborative team at work or improving the experience of customers for the product I'm supporting.  I'm passionate about every project I work on!
